# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Detection
Developed a real-time sign language detection app using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
Utilized a Faster R-CNN model with ResNet50 v1 for precise gesture recognition.
Created an end-to-end pipeline, from data collection to real-time detection, enhancing accessibility for sign language users.

Steps:
1. Collect images for deep learning using your webcam and OpenCV
2. Label images for sign language detection using LabelImg
3. Setup Tensorflow Object Detection pipeline configuration
4. Use transfer learning to train a deep learning model
5. Detect sign language in real time using OpenCV.
